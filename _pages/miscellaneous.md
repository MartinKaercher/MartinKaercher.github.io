Colemak
===
What even is Colemak? It is a modern keyboard layout that tries to minimise finger movement to ease typing. The usual layout on an English keyboard is QWERTY where many often-used letters are quite far to reach. Colemak tries to mitigate this to position those letters on the homerow, that is, the keys that your fingers are resting on in the default position for touch typing.

Typing
====
In many jobs nowadays the keyboard is the primary "tool" we use to interact with a computer. Usually we also a mouse besides for navigation in opened windows but terminal editors such as Vim enable a complete mouseless workflow. This workflow can be enhanced by a fast typing speed as well as touch typing, i.e. typing without having to look occasionally at the keybord, next to remembering a million different shortcuts of course. There is a plethora of different websites out there where you can train to type faster or learn a new keyboard layout. 

Vim
===
Vim is a very cool terminal editors that allows for a completely mousless workflow. This is particularly convenient if you can touch type or type quite fast in general. Of course, there are Vim keybindings also for VSCode but an advantage of Vim is that it is lightweight and has therefore super fast startup times.

Well, it seems there is nothing here yet, but stay tuned.

Typing
====
In many jobs nowadays the keyboard is the primary `tool` we use to interact with a computer. Usually we also a mouse besides for navigation in opened windows but terminal editors such as Vim enable a complete mouseless workflow. This workflow can be enhanced by a fast typing speed as well as touch typing, i.e. typing without having to look occasionally at the keybord, next to remembering a million different shortcuts of course. There is a plethora of different websites out there where you can train to type faster or learn a new keyboard layout.

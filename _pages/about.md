Looks like you found your way to my personal webpage. First a few words about myself. I am currently a post doc at Milan University workingon analyses of the distribution of galaxies in the universe. Before that, I did my PhD at the Aix-Marseille University in France. If you want to know more about my past you check out my [CV](https://martinkaercher.github.io/cv). In case you are interested in my past teaching then you can find more information [here](https://martinkaercher.github.io/teaching). Then on [this page](https://martinkaercher.github.io/miscellaneous) you find some miscellaneous information about myself which are not related to my job or research.
